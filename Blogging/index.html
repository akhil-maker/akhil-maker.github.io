                I am writing what I am watching and experiencing presently. I am sitting in my room and a cloudy light is entering to my room. It is afternoon and the weather is getting cloudy. I am watching television and slowly a clean and shiny weather transformed to cloudy and dark weather. Just now a wave of wind touched me and ran away. I am feeling like I am sitting under a tree shade and the shade of tree is so large it has covered the ceiling over me. A slow bridge started to blow in this weather which is cool. Well the weather is little cloudy from morning but now it is getting dark and a feel of rain is rising in the mind. A forecast of heart is saying that clouds can fall.rain, drops, drip-863339.jpg

In this weather, one immense feeling rise in my heart. My eyes are eagerly waiting to see the falling rain drops. My ears are wishing to hear sounds of falling rain drops and my heart is waiting to feel this rain. Just now, suddenly I have heard the sound of thundering clouds. It is like the clouds are announcing the arrival of rain which will fall and quench the thirst of land. I cannot wait any more to see the rain and a thrilling sound of thunder of dark clouds which whenever collide create a sharp light that seems to flow from sky to earth and the sound of thunder will come after it. Have some scientific reasoning, necessary to mention (reason will be in some other blog), that light travels faster than sound. The speed of sound in air is about 343 meters per second while the speed of light in air is approx 3 x 10^8 meters per second.dark clouds, clouds, after the storm-228883.jpg

Let’s get back to our running commentary of what we see live (just a joke). Still I am waiting when the rain will fall and it will give me pleasure. Hope the rain will fall soon…..

“Nothing better than the sound of heavy rain and a deep silence in background and a soothing music.”
